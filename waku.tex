\section{Introduction}

\paragraph{Outline}
The problem domain is P2P messaging. This has some issues when it comes to scalability, spam reistance, and offline usage. Here we introduce our contribution to it.

The main "ping" or idea is making Whisper run on resource restricted device. That's the game.

\section{Problem}
Offline, BW, Spam.

\section{Idea}
\section{Details}
Scalability model, simulation.

Status app as a case study?

\section{Related work}
